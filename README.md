# Project3_Clustering-Customer-Segmentation-Project

This project focuses on customer segmentation using purchasing history from a mall's membership cards. Despite being less challenging, it underscores the significance of quick data understanding and subsequent Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). EDA involves observing customer distributions across variables, exploring relationships, and identifying key features for cluster analysis. The project then utilizes K-Means Clustering to group customers based on their characteristics. Alternative clustering methods, such as hierarchical clustering and density-based clustering, are acknowledged for flexibility. The outcome is distinct customer clusters with labeled characteristics, aiding in tailored marketing and services. The project not only showcases expertise in EDA and clustering but also provides practical insights for effective customer segmentation.
